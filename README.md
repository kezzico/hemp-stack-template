# Hemp Stack ‚Äì Workspace Template

The **Hemp Stack** combines the strengths of **PHP** and **Node.js (Express)** into a lightweight, flexible development stack.

Instead of choosing between ‚Äúold school‚Äù PHP or ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Node, Hemp Stack embraces both:

* **PHP** handles templating and server-side rendering for HTML.
* **Express** handles APIs, state management, JSON responses, and async workflows.

Think of PHP as your **chef** preparing HTML, and Express as your **delivery driver** making sure data gets where it needs to go quickly.

## Why Hemp? üå±

Humans don‚Äôt always like what they don‚Äôt understand, so let‚Äôs make it clear:

* **Separation of concerns** ‚Äì PHP takes care of views, Node focuses on data and state.
* **Simple + modern** ‚Äì Keep the speed of server-side rendering while unlocking JSON APIs, async workflows, and modern backend patterns.
* **Flexibility** ‚Äì Works with plain HTML forms, JSON APIs, and frontend frameworks if you want to scale up.
* **Grassroots feel** ‚Äì Lightweight, practical, and accessible to both new and experienced developers.

## How It Works

* **State** can be stored in cookies, forms, or query params.
* **PHP** is great for HTML templating and quick server-side rendering.
* **Express** powers REST endpoints, JSON responses, and async logic.
* **Forms** can post directly to Express; Express can respond with JSON or set cookies for downstream navigation.

This makes Hemp Stack a bridge between the simplicity of classic web development and the flexibility of modern stacks.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kezzico/workspace-template.git
cd workspace-template
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
# Node dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) PHP dependencies via composer
composer install
```

Run the stack:

```bash
# Start Express API
npm start

# Serve PHP via your local server (e.g., php -S localhost:8000)

```

Open in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## When to Use Hemp Stack

* You want **fast, simple HTML rendering** without a heavy frontend framework.
* You need **modern APIs** for JSON, state management, or mobile apps.
* You want to keep things **small, accessible, and fun** while still being future-proof.
